UniformGridLayout is Java Swing-compatible layout manager that dynamically calculates horizontal gap between components
and laying out components in grid-like structure, where grid cell width is maximum of all components widths and grid
cell height is maximum of all components heights. All components are placed at the center of their grid cell.
